--- Sort panels into reading order for a reading mode.
---
--- Panels within the same row run right-to-left in manga mode and left-to-right
--- in comic mode; rows themselves always run top to bottom. Shared by every
--- detector so panel order never depends on which one produced the rectangles.
---
--- Rows are deliberately built from their *top edges*, rather than by
--- chaining together panels whose vertical centres happen to be near each
--- other. A tall panel beside two stacked panels otherwise links the upper and
--- lower tiers into one row; sorting that oversized row by x then sends the
--- lower panel before the upper one. That breaks both left-to-right comic and
--- right-to-left manga flow.
---
--- A layout can also place a tall trailing panel beside a vertical stack of
--- later panels. That panel shares a top edge with the first panel in the
--- stack, but its position on the trailing edge means the stack is read first:
--- comic flow enters the left-hand stack and manga flow enters the right-hand
--- stack, returning to the tall panel only after that stack is complete.
---
--- @param panels PPPanel[] Unordered panel rectangles.
--- @param mode PPReadingMode Reading order mode.
--- @return PPPanel[] panels The same table, sorted in place.
